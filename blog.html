                        <h2>Influence of music on Einstein’s creativity</h2>
                        <p>Written By <span>Tebogo Koza</span></p>
                   </div>
                    <div class="paragraphs">
                        <p><span>W</span>hen one envisages of a music virtuoso; quickly and elegantly, fingers moving across the ebony and ivory keys. Beethoven, Herbie Hancock, or Debussy’s name quickly flashes before one’s eyes. But less is known of Einstein’s proficiency to beguile and wow on both the piano and violin- be it as it may,  ranked ‘amateur’ by refinery of skill to the aforementioned giants. Backed by the legend that he’d use the skill-set to get laid; by my base standards, sounds just about Ingenious and cunning as Clair de Lune or the Moonlight Sonata.</p>
                        <p>But the aim of this piece is to unpeel by layer, the influence of music on Einstein’s way of thinking through his grand theories- that have ever since established him as poster child of genius.</p>
                        <p>Detailed in some of his quotable statements; Einstein truly ordained music as the substance that urged his thinking into physics problems- not so much so for mathematics. ”Imagination is more important than knowledge” he once exclaimed; a crusade of inspiration and intuition – truly a romantic, at the heart of physics problems, from which of course, cutting the right artery to diffuse a volatile bomb, has always been the answer, by the method of guessing what an equation may look like.</p>
                        <p>Much like how Richard Feynman sought out the elephant in the room in pursuit of solutions to the quantum electrodynamics problems pertaining the interaction between light and matter; by reducing the complex mathematics into pictorial diagrams. Einstein, whenever he would stumble upon a wall, he’d get in his feelings- cuddled up in his bed, gloomy like a heartbroken teen, hopes shattered that he’d come to an end as a phenomenal physicist. Upon playing the piano, the structure and composition of the music would conjure otherwise ‘other worldly’ ideas- whose potency would cement what most modern physics is preoccupied with.</p>
                        <p>Recently research in cognitive science suggests that we all have the incline for ‘divergent thinking’; a stemming of original ideas, wherein upon choosing which of the string of original ideas is most likely to be more practicable and successful, this is called convergent thinking. And in an experiment with participants. It was found that music evoked more of divergent thinking, thus increasing the number of the plausible innovative solutions; especially the stimulus of happy jingles. Although the process doesn’t stimulate convergent thinking, which requires the right solution amongst innumerable relative possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Whence did Albert Einstein derive such articulation in this fuzzy business? - Intuition. It is said that, the music assured him that his approach was right, by mere sense of feeling- an experience he expounded in detail to Max Wertheimer; a scholar of creativity.</p>
                        <p>Music has come to be known as an instrument of improving cognition and learning. And in Einstein’s case, it was more than for recreation, but a source of inspiration; from which art and science can borrow. For in a dull universe, whose audible background was zero decibels- both Special relativity and General relativity would maybe cease- for what could have spurred him on whenever he would trip over a Goliath of an impediment?... As Fela Kuti once said,” Music is the king of all professions”, a sentiment that echoed with Einstein, when he said he would have been a musician had he not been a physicist.</p>

                        <p><span>I</span>nfluence is the motivating force of our society and is an integral part of our overall existence.</p>
                        <p>Many claim to be impervious to the powers of influence, falling short of any valuable degree of understanding of this concept known as influence. Therefore before such an arrogant claim can be made , one must first acquire a reasonable understanding of influence so that its dimensions may be known.</p>
                        <p>So what is influence?</p>
                        <p>Influence is the capacity to have an effect on the character, development or behaviour of someone or something - basically put, influence is the motivating factor of change, be it a change in nature or the provocation of a particular course of action.</p>
                        <p>You see no one is impervious to influence albeit we may choose to avoid the myriad of negative influences that lodge themselves into the structure of our mentality. The first step is acknowledgement and if we deny our susceptibility to influences there can be no progress. And just incase you don’t share the same sentiment, progress should be the fundamental goal of our lives.</p>
                        <p>We find influence on a universal, environmental, social and personal level. For example, on a personal level our thoughts may influence our feelings and our feelings may influence our actions. In this sense the danger of our lack of awareness of the power of influence comes as not realising the extent to which our assumptions may cause us to behave in a harsh or unprogressive manner.</p>
                        <p>As you may see, influence is a double edged sword - the influence of music illustrates this point quite well. The lyrics on a song may strictly serve the purpose of influencing one to partake of the lowly pleasures of life or they may challenge the thinking of the listener, inspiring perseverance and the evolution of the human experience.</p>
                        <p>And so to assume a matured level of responsibility is a must because we all have a certain degree of influence within the lives of the people we come across.</p>
                        <p>It is up to you to use the power of influence for the greater good. To inspire love, self assurance and personal development.</p>
